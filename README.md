## 🧠 Problem Statement

In thousands of under-resourced schools across India, one teacher often handles **multiple grades** in a **single classroom**, juggling diverse subjects, student levels, and languages. They lack access to:

- Hyper-local teaching aids
- Differentiated learning materials
- Visual content and quick explanations
- Tools that speak their language and their students’ too

⚠️ The current platforms like Google Classroom are **not built** for these hyper-local, multi-grade, resource-limited scenarios.
